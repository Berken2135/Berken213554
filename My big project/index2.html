            <h4 class="h4">What are the advantages of Çapa Educational Institution and Private School?</h4>
            </div>
<div class="yazi-cercevesi">
             <p class="yazi"> The importance of education in the development of societies is great. It is not possible to follow the educational process consecutively in advanced age. We cannot ignore this process of development and the payment of private education, unfortunately this is not possible. It is not possible to ignore that the biggest share in the development of countries is the human power that brings them together.

                I believe this understanding of development is one of the reasons why all kinds of education are included in democratic systems. For these reasons; When it comes to private education schools, Tek's educational institutions come to mind. learned basic knowledge and skills, revealed and analyzed what he saw, can relax, can give ideas on his own, can produce, can solve problems
          
                They are raised not to ask for help from others. It is possible to say that private education programs are more advantageous than some public schools in terms of physical structure, course materials and requirements, and personal aspects. Private school means raising successful students. Private schools provide full-time education and training. The course tool is very well equipped with equipment features. The number of students in classes is less and this causes a student to perceive and learn better. Gyms, libraries and computers are available. For this reason, it is more successful.
          
                The fact that private schools were outnumbered in all provinces of Anatolia, even in large districts, tipped the balance towards the activities of private schools. Class size is very important in education and training. The class size of public schools is very acceptable compared to private schools, so education and training in public schools is less than private schools. While classes in public schools have a capacity of 60 people, private schools have a capacity of 20 people.</p>
